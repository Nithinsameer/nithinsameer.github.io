Individuals dominated by Sattva are typically thoughtful, peaceful, and virtuous. They seek knowledge and are drawn towards spiritual practices. However, excessive Sattva can lead to attachment to knowledge and a sense of pride in oneâ€™s own righteousness or wisdom.",

People influenced by Rajas are often energetic, action-oriented, and motivated but can also be prone to agitation, dissatisfaction, and a relentless pursuit of worldly goals. Rajas can lead to a cycle of endless desires and the resultant frustration or unhappiness when these desires are unfulfilled.",
            tamas: "Tamas is characterized by qualities of darkness, ignorance, laziness, and confusion. It is the state of inertia, inactivity, and materialistic tendencies. Individuals dominated by Tamas may exhibit resistance to change, a lack of motivation, and a sense of apathy or depression. Tamas can hinder clarity of thought, leading to delusion and misunderstanding of reality."
